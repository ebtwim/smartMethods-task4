# GET Variable Receiver

This project demonstrates a simple web application that receives a variable through the GET method, uses PHP to handle the variable, and stores it in a database.

## Description

This project showcases how to handle user input through the GET method in a web application. It utilizes PHP as the server-side scripting language to receive the variable and interact with a MySQL database to store the received value.

## Features

- Receives a variable value via the GET method from a web form or URL query string.
- Uses PHP to handle the received variable data.
- Establishes a connection with a MySQL database.
- Stores the received variable value in the database for future retrieval or data processing.

## Installation and Setup

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have a web server environment with PHP support set up on your machine.

2. Clone this repository to your local machine or download the code as a ZIP file.

3. Create a MySQL database for storing the variables received through the GET method.

4. Update the database connection details in the `receiver.php` file. Modify the variables `$dbHost`, `$dbUser`, `$dbPass`, and `$dbName` with your database credentials.

5. Move the project files to your web server's document root directory.

6. Start your web server, and make sure it is running correctly.

7. Open a web browser and access the project by entering the appropriate URL in the address bar.

## Usage

1. Launch the web application in your preferred web browser.

2. You will see a form where you can enter a value for the variable.

3. Submit the form to send the variable using the GET method.

4. The `receiver.php` script will process the received variable and store it in the specified MySQL database.

5. To retrieve and view the stored variable, you can use a separate PHP script or access the database directly.
